# GenerativeArt-CreativeEmbeddedSys
This project was part of a collaborative generative art gallery for my Creative Embedded Systems class. We were tasked with creating art displays with our Arduino ESP32 LilyGO T-Display Screens and envelopes we customized to fit our designs. The theme was fall so all of our projects took different interpretations of what that could mean to make a beatiful gallery display.

In the file included in this github repo named fall_generative_art_sketch.ino, you should follow this instructions to display this on your own device:

Prequisites:
    -TTGO T-display Driver
    -Arduino IDE
    -ESP32 TTGO T-display
    -TFT_eSPI library (Installable through Arduino IDE)
    -ESP32 Board Definition/Library Installed
    

1. Download the fall_generative_art_sketch.ino file in this repository
2. Once in your default downloads folder, right-click or CTRL+click on the file to open in the Arduino IDE
3. Connect your board to your computer
4. Locate the Arduino Tools menu (for Mac this should be at the top of your screen) > Board > esp32 > ESP32 Dev Module (or whichever one you have)
5. Select your port
6. Run the code (arrow button)!

  *Note this code has the potential to display differently on your display if your device is bigger or smaller than a 1.14 inch LCD

In case you don't have an Arduino ESP32 LilyGO T-Display, you can always check out the gif above to see how the sketch runs :)

Here's a link to my blog post which delves a bit more into the inspiration behind the project: 
Spoiler alert: It involves pumpkin spice and the great Frankie Beverly (Rest in Peace)!
